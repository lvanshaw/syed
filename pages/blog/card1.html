      <h1>Understanding Unity Script Lifecycle</h1>
      <img src="../../img/blog/card1/lifecycle.png" />
      <h2>OnEnable()</h2>
      <p>
        <em>OnEnable()</em> is called after the <em>Awake</em> method is executed
        immediately. It's also called whenever the script gets enabled.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>OnApplicationPause(bool)</h2>
      <p>
        <em>OnApplicationPause(bool)</em> is called after <em>OnEnable</em> if
        the script is enabled, and it's called after <em>Awake</em> if the script
        is not enabled. It returns <em>False</em> whenever a game application
        comes to the foreground, indicating it's currently running. It returns
        <em>True</em> whenever a game application goes to the background or
        switches to another page.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      
      <h2>OnApplicationFocus(bool)</h2>
      <p>
        <em>OnApplicationFocus(bool)</em> is called immediately after
        <em>OnApplicationPause</em>. It's also called whenever the game
        application gains or loses focus. It returns <em>True</em> when the
        application comes to the foreground and is currently in focus. It returns
        <em>False</em> when the application goes to the background or loses focus.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      
      <h2>Start()</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Start()</em> is called after <em>Awake</em>, <em>OnEnable</em>,
        <em>OnApplicationPause</em>, and <em>OnApplicationFocus</em> It's called
        only once in a script's lifecycle, and it's executed if the script is
        enabled.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      
      <h2>FixedUpdate()</h2>
      <p>
        <em>FixedUpdate()</em> is called after the first frame of the scene is
        created. It's part of the update and render cycle and is used to
        determine the object's next state in subsequent frames. It's called after
        every predefined fixed time interval. The fixed time step can be
        configured in Edit -> Project Settings -> Time -> Fixed Time Step.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      
      <h2>Update()</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Update()</em> is called once per frame continuously, according to
        the frames per second (FPS) rate of the game.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      
      <h2>LateUpdate()</h2>
      <p>
        <em>LateUpdate()</em> is called once after every <em>Update</em> method
        call.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      
      <h2>OnGUI()</h2>
      <p>
        <em>OnGUI()</em> is called many times per frame and is best for drawing
        GUI elements and handling GUI events. It's used for drawing UI buttons and
        handling click events.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      
      <h2>OnApplicationQuit()</h2>
      <p>
        <em>OnApplicationQuit()</em> is called when the user quits the game
        application. It's also called when the user stops play mode in the Unity
        editor. Note that when the user quits the game, it first loses focus and
        then quits the game. This method is best for saving or persisting any game
        data.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      
      <h2>OnDisable()</h2>
      <p>
        <em>OnDisable()</em> is called whenever the script gets disabled. You can
        use <em>System.GC.Collect()</em> to free up unused memory locations.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      
      <h2>OnDestroy()</h2>
      <p>
        <em>OnDestroy()</em> is called when the object is about to be destroyed.
        It's called when the current scene ends or is unloaded, after the game
        application quits, and when the user stops play mode in Unity Editor.
